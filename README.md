# Load the Uber dataset from Kaggle
df = pd.read_csv('uber.csv')
df.head()
```

```python
print("Dataset Shape:", df.shape)
print("\nData Types:")
print(df.dtypes)
print("\nMissing Values:")
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

**✅ Initial Data Assessment:**
- **Total Records:** 200,000+ ride records
- **Features:** 7 columns (pickup/dropoff coordinates, datetime, fare_amount, passenger_count)
- **Missing Values:** Detected nulls in dropoff coordinates
- **Data Quality Issues:** Pickup_datetime not in proper datetime format

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

```python
# Comprehensive descriptive statistics
df.describe()
```

**✅ Statistical Summary Generated:**
- **Mean, Median, Mode:** Calculated for all numerical variables
- **Standard Deviation:** Measured data variability
- **Quartiles & Ranges:** Identified data distribution patterns
- **Outlier Detection:** Found extreme fare values and invalid coordinates

### Data Quality Assessment

**✅ Data Quality Issues Identified:**
- Negative or zero fare amounts detected
- Invalid passenger counts (0 or >6 passengers)
- Missing dropoff coordinates in some records
- Extreme outlier values requiring investigation

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

```python
# Data cleaning pipeline
# 1. Remove unnecessary columns
df = df.drop('Unnamed: 0', axis=1, errors='ignore')

# 2. Convert datetime format
df['pickup_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(df['pickup_datetime'])

# 3. Handle missing values
df = df.dropna()

# 4. Filter invalid records
df = df[(df['fare_amount'] > 0) & 
        (df['passenger_count'] >= 1) & 
        (df['passenger_count'] <= 6)]

# 5. Remove extreme outliers
df = df[df['fare_amount'] <= df['fare_amount'].quantile(0.99)]
```

**Key Cleaning Actions:**
- ✅ Dropped `Unnamed: 0` column (redundant index)
- ✅ Converted `pickup_datetime` to proper datetime format
- ✅ Removed records with missing dropoff coordinates
- ✅ Filtered out invalid fare amounts (≤ 0) and passenger counts
- ✅ Applied outlier treatment using 99th percentile threshold

```python
print("Cleaned Dataset Shape:", df.shape)
```

**📈 Final Dataset:** 195,000+ rows × 7 columns (clean and analysis-ready)

<img width="1139" height="632" alt="clean_data" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02df9cf7-8d4e-4336-bbcd-1cb7864fed50" />


## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

```python
# Extract temporal features
df['hour'] = df['pickup_datetime'].dt.hour
df['day'] = df['pickup_datetime'].dt.day
df['month'] = df['pickup_datetime'].dt.month
df['year'] = df['pickup_datetime'].dt.year
df['day_of_week'] = df['pickup_datetime'].dt.dayofweek
df['weekday_name'] = df['pickup_datetime'].dt.day_name()

# Create categorical features
df['is_weekend'] = df['day_of_week'].isin([5, 6])
df['is_peak'] = df['hour'].isin([7, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19])

# Calculate trip distance (Haversine formula)
df['distance_km'] = haversine_distance(df['pickup_latitude'], 
                                      df['pickup_longitude'],
                                      df['dropoff_latitude'], 
                                      df['dropoff_longitude'])
```

**✅ New Features Created:**
- **Temporal Features:** Hour, day, month, year, day_of_week
- **Categorical Indicators:** is_weekend, is_peak, weekday_name
- **Calculated Metrics:** distance_km using Haversine formula
- **Business Logic:** Peak hours defined as 7-9 AM and 5-7 PM
